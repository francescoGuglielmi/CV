 # Francesco Guglielmi

I am a Full Stack Software Developer and part of Makers Alumni. I often bring new ideas to the team and to my employers, such as adopting a more interconnected coordination of the team through the communication of every actionable update on a common area of work or proposing a rebranding concept with the strategies to achieve a better service and user experience. With my pragmatic approach to problems I look forward to achieve more in the tech industry. I challenge myself by constantly leaning new things and strive to continue to develop my skills, both human and technical.

## Skills
  - _Problem Solver_:  
    Any task that seems hard is just the sum of smaller processes that solved individually can achive great results.

  - _Creative Mind_:  
    "What if..." is a question I ask a lot. My curiosity for things sparks quickly and sometimes this leads me to take aspects from different things I learned or saw and combine them together.
 
  - _Attitude_:  
    The sky is the limit. I believe that with strong motivation people can do amazing things. My persistence applying to Makers proves it, and after 1 year of attempts I got selected as a successful candidate. 
 
  - _Ethic_:
    Nothing is more fulfilling than working in an environment and for a cause that reflect your true self. By becoming a Full Stack Developer I have the tools to be the change I want to see in the world and help other human beings to do well in life by offering them better tools to manage their lifestyles and encourage them to be the best version of themselves. 

  - _Collaborative Spirit_:  
    I believe that positive attitudes make a good team. That is why it's important to support your co-workers and be open to learn from them too.
    When there is a team working for a common project, good communication between the parts is key to deliver efficiently and in time.

  - _Logic Communicator_:  
    I am used to explain concepts as a cause-effect mechanism. Doing this, I am able to describe what I know in a way that is easier to understand for people who need to receive updates on the status of a project.
