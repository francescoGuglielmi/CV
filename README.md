 # Francesco Guglielmi

I am a trainee Full Stack Developer at Makers. I always go the extra mile finding solutions and explainations, such as adopting an effective algorithm to schedule my colleagues rota or proposing a rebranding concept with the strategies to achieve a better service. With my pragmatic approach to problems I look forward to achieve even more in the tech industry. I challenge myself by constantly leaning new things and continue to develop my skills as tecnologies and people progress. I believe this is the best way for anyone to become successful in their career.

## Work Experience

**Myself**   
_Student_ (05/12/2022 - 16/01/2023)  

Waiting for my course to begin, I started to warm up by refreshing the knowledge previously gained in tech. During this time I achieved:

  - Knowledge of the basics of Javascript.
  - Improved understanding of Python, HTML and CSS.

## In My Previous Life... 
  **Between 16/09/2017 and 05/12/2022 I was:**
    - Office Administrator for Scream Couriers 
    - Delivery Driver for Scream Couriers
    - Customer Fulfillment Advisor for Argos
    - Delivery Driver for DPD
    - Parcel Office Operative for Ballymore

**Where I:**
  - Improved social skills and learned basic body language interpretation
  - Improved my customer service skills 
  - Learned how to multitask on a timed schedule

**But especially:**
  - Got inspired to change my career into software development and started to take my first lessons in HTML and CSS.

## Skills
  - _Problem Solver_:  
    Any task that seems hard is just the sum of smaller processes that solved individually can achive great results.

  - _Creative Mind_:  
    "What if..." is a question I ask a lot. My curiosity for things sparks quickly and sometimes this leads me to take aspects from different things I       learned or saw and combine them together.
 
  - _Attitude_:  
    The sky is the limit. I believe that with strong motivation people can do amazing things. My persistence applying to Makers proves it, and after 1       year   of attempts I got selected as a successful candidate. 
 
  - _Ethic_:
    Nothing is more fulfilling than working in an environment and for a cause that reflect your true self. By becoming a Full Stack Developer I will have     the tools to be the change I want to see in the world and help other human beings to do well in life by offering them better tools to manage their       lifestyles and encourage them to be the best version of themselves. 

  - _Collaborative Spirit_:  
    I believe that positive attitudes make a good team. That is why it's important to support your co-workers and be open to learn from them too.
    When there is a team working for a common project, good communication between the parts is key to deliver efficiently and in time.

  - _Logic Communicator_:  
    I am used to explain concepts as a cause-effect mechanism. For example, doing this I am able to describe what I know in a way that is easier to           understand for people who need to receive updates on the status of a project.
