## Francesco Guglielmi

Formerly a delivery driver, I'm now a trainee Full Stack Developer at Makers. I helped my previous employers finding solutions to their problems and discussed with them the strategies to achieve a better service. Now I look forward to achieve even more in the tech industry. I have a pragmatic approach to problems, I love to learn new things, change my perspective, change other's.

## Work Experience

**Myself** (05/12/2022 - 16/01/2023)  
_Tech Student_

Waiting for my course to begin, I started to warm up by refreshing the knowladge gained previously in tech. during this time I achieved:

- Knowledge of the basics of Javascript.
- Improved understanding of Python, HTML and CSS.

**In My Previous Life...** (16/09/2017 - 05/12/2022)
_Office Administrator_ for ScreamCouriers 
_Delivery Driver_ for Scream Couriers
_Customer Fulfillment Advisor_ for Argos
_Delivery Driver_ for DPD
_Parcel Office Operative_ for Ballymore

Where I (in order):
- Improved my English
- Learned to drive in the UK
- Improved social skills and learned basic body language interpretation
- Improved my customer service skills 
- Learned how to become organized in life and how to optimize time 

But especially:
- Got inspired to become a software developer and started to take my first lessons in HTML and CSS.

## Skills
- _Problem Solver_ :
  Any unsolvable problem is just the sum of smaller problems that individually can be solved or again scomposed.

- _Creative Mind_ :
  "What if..." is a question I ask a lot. My curiosity for things sparks quickly and sometimes this leads me to take aspects from different things I learned or saw and combine them together.

- _Positive Attitude_ :
  The sky is the limit. A risk is a risk but sometimes you have to take risks to achieve better results. I prefer to think that there is a specific way to hit any target, it's just there for us to be found. That's why I never give up on my goals.

- _Collaborative Spirit_ :
  Positive attitudes make a good team! That's why it's important to support your co-workers and be open to learn from them too.
  When there is a team working for a common project, good communication between the parts is key to deliver efficiently and in time.

- _Logic Communicator_ :
  As per my pragmatic approach, I often explain concepts as a cause-effect mechanism. Doing this, I am able to describe what I know in an easier to understand way for people who need to receive updates on the status of a project.

- _A Sense Of Ethic_ :
  Nothing is more fullfilling that working in an environment and for a cause that reflects your true self. By becoming a Full Stack Developer I will be more able to be the change I want to see in the world and help other humans beings to do well in life.
