## Francesco Guglielmi

Formerly a delivery driver, I'm now a trainee Full Stack Developer at Makers. I helped my previous employers finding solutions to their problems and discussed with them the strategies to achieve a better service. Now I look forward to achieve even more in the tech industry. I have a pragmatic approach to problems, I love to learn new things, change my perspective, change other's.

## Work Experience

**Myself** 
_Student_ (05/12/2022 - 16/01/2023)  

Waiting for my course to begin, I started to warm up by refreshing the knowledge previously gained in tech. During this time I achieved:

- Knowledge of the basics of Javascript.
- Improved understanding of Python, HTML and CSS.

## In My Previous Life... 
**Between 16/09/2017 and 05/12/2022 I was:**
- Office Administrator for Scream Couriers 
- Delivery Driver for Scream Couriers
- Customer Fulfillment Advisor for Argos
- Delivery Driver for DPD
- Parcel Office Operative for Ballymore

**Where I:**
- Improved my English
- Learned to drive in the UK
- Improved social skills and learned basic body language interpretation
- Improved my customer service skills 
- Learned how to become organized in life and how to optimize time 

**But especially:**
- Got inspired to change my career into software development and started to take my first lessons in HTML and CSS.

## Skills
- _Problem Solver_:  
  Any unsolvable problem is just the sum of smaller problems that individually can be solved or again scomposed.

- _Creative Mind_:  
  "What if..." is a question I ask a lot. My curiosity for things sparks quickly and sometimes this leads me to take aspects from different things I learned or saw and combine them together.

- _Positive Attitude_:  
  The sky is the limit. A risk is a risk but sometimes you have to take risks to achieve better results. I prefer to think that there is a specific way to hit any target, it's just there for us to be found. That's why I never give up on my goals.

- _Collaborative Spirit_:  
  Positive attitudes make a good team! That's why it's important to support your co-workers and be open to learn from them too.
  When there is a team working for a common project, good communication between the parts is key to deliver efficiently and in time.

- _Logic Communicator_:  
  As per my pragmatic approach, I often explain concepts as a cause-effect mechanism. For example doing this, I am able to describe what I know in an easier to understand way for people who need to receive updates on the status of a project.

- _A Sense Of Ethic_:  
  Nothing is more fullfilling that working in an environment and for a cause that reflects your true self. By becoming a Full Stack Developer I will be more able to be the change I want to see in the world and help other humans beings to do well in life.
